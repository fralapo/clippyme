# Sentence-boundary snapping (the truncation fix).
#
# `snap_clip_to_words` only fixes a clip opening/closing mid-WORD. Users still
# saw clips cut mid-SENTENCE because the LLM's [start,end] drifts and the 0.6s
# word-snap budget can't reach the actual sentence edge. This layer snaps the
# clip to SENTENCE boundaries using the punctuation already attached to word
# tokens (Deepgram smart_format / Whisper). It is asymmetric and guarded, per
# the design council:
#   - START moves BACKWARD (generously) to the sentence onset → include the
#     whole opening sentence. Backward moves are nearly free (don't fight the
#     60s cap or the next clip).
#   - END moves FORWARD (tightly) to the sentence-final word → finish the
#     thought. Forward moves fight the duration cap + neighbour overlap, so the
#     budget is smaller and the clamps below always win.
#   - Hard invariants (max duration, no overlap with a neighbour clip, source
#     bounds) WIN over the sentence preference. On any conflict the function
#     degrades — start-only, then end-only, then all the way back to the
#     word-snapped edges. It is NEVER worse than `snap_clip_to_words` alone.
#   - Detection is guarded against false positives (abbreviations, decimals,
#     single-letter initials, bracketed audio-event tokens) so unpunctuated /
#     multilingual transcripts no-op gracefully instead of cutting on "Dr.".
